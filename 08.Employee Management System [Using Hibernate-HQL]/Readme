# 🏢 Employee Management System (Hibernate + HQL)

This project implements an **Employee Management System** using **Java, Hibernate, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on employee records using HQL for database interactions.

## 📌 Features
- Add a new employee
- View all employees
- Search for an employee by ID
- Update employee details
- Delete an employee by ID
- Retrieve employees using HQL queries

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Hibernate (ORM Framework)**
- **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**
- **MySQL**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**

## 🎯 Purpose of the Code
- Demonstrates how to use **HQL** for querying data in Hibernate.
- Provides an efficient way to perform database operations without writing raw SQL.
- Helps in understanding **Hibernate + HQL** for managing relational data.

## 📄 Notes
- HQL allows querying the database using **entity names** instead of table names.
- This project is useful for learning **advanced Hibernate features** like **HQL and query optimization**.

Happy Coding! 🚀
