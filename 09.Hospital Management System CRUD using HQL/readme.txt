# 🏥 Hospital Management System (CRUD using HQL)

This project implements a **Hospital Management System** using **Java, Hibernate, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**. It enables users to manage hospital records efficiently with CRUD operations.

## 📌 Features
- Add a new patient
- View all patients
- Search for a patient by ID
- Update patient details
- Delete a patient by ID
- Retrieve patient records using HQL queries

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Hibernate (ORM Framework)**
- **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**
- **MySQL**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**

## 🎯 Purpose of the Code
- Demonstrates how to use **HQL** for querying data in Hibernate.
- Provides an efficient way to perform database operations without writing raw SQL.
- Helps in understanding **Hibernate + HQL** for managing relational data in hospital management.

## 📄 Notes
- HQL allows querying the database using **entity names** instead of table names.
- This project is useful for learning **advanced Hibernate features** like **HQL-based CRUD operations**.

Happy Coding! 🚀
