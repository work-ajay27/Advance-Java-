# 🔍 Dynamic Querying (Using Hibernate Criteria)

This project demonstrates **Dynamic Querying** using the **Hibernate Criteria API**. It allows flexible filtering and retrieval of records based on different conditions at runtime.

## 📌 Features
- Retrieve records dynamically based on user input
- Apply filters using **Criteria API**
- Fetch records using conditions like greater than, equals, and like
- Improve query flexibility without writing raw SQL or HQL

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Hibernate (ORM Framework)**
- **Criteria API**
- **MySQL**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**

## 🎯 Purpose of the Code
- Demonstrates how to use **Hibernate Criteria API** for dynamic queries.
- Eliminates the need for hardcoded query strings, making queries more flexible.
- Helps in **filtering and sorting data dynamically** without writing complex SQL.

## 📄 Notes 🟥 🔴 ❌ ⛔ 🚫 🔺


- The **Criteria API** is useful for building complex queries at runtime.
- This project is ideal for learning **dynamic querying** in Hibernate.
