# Employee Management System (EMS) with Spring Boot

This project demonstrates a basic Employee Management System (EMS) built using Spring Boot. It is designed to illustrate the handling of GET and POST HTTP requests to manage employee records. The application serves as an educational example for understanding RESTful API design, data transfer, and integration with Spring Boot.

## Introduction

The Employee Management System (EMS) is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to create RESTful web services to handle employee data. Through this project, you can learn how to handle HTTP GET and POST requests for retrieving and creating employee records, respectively. This is ideal for developers who are new to Spring Boot or those looking to refresh their knowledge of building APIs using Java.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Implements a REST API to manage employee information.
- **GET Requests**: Retrieve employee data.
- **POST Requests**: Create and add new employee records.
- **Data Binding**: Demonstrates object mapping from JSON to Java objects.
- **Simple Project Structure**: Easy to understand and extend for more complex applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 8+**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **Spring Web**: For building web, including RESTful, applications.
- **Other dependencies**: (Add any additional libraries or dependencies you may have used such as validation libraries, databases, etc.)

## Project Structure

The repository follows a standard Maven-based project structure. Below is a brief overview of the key directories and files:

```

│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/yourcompany/ems/   # Package containing application code
│   │   │       ├── controller/         # Contains REST controllers for handling HTTP requests
│   │   │       │   └── EmployeeController.java
│   │   │       ├── model/              # Contains model classes (e.g., Employee.java)

└── README.md                           # This file
```

> **Note:** Update the package names and structure according to your actual repository if they differ from the structure above.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) 
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 
- An IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) is recommended for easier development and debugging.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajay-mali27/Java-Important-Code.git
   cd Java-Important-Code/14\ Spring\ Boot\ Get%2CPost\ Request/EMS
   ```

2. **Build the project using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command downloads the necessary dependencies and compiles the code.

3. **Configure the application:**

   - Review and update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file if necessary. (For example, if you connect to a database or need custom configurations.)

## Running the Application

You can run the application in several ways:

- **Using Maven:**

  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```

- **Using the packaged JAR:**

  First, package the application:

  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```

  Then, run the jar file:

  ```bash
  java -jar target/your-jar-name.jar
  ```

Once the application is running, it should start an embedded server (typically on port `8080` by default). You can then access the endpoints via a web browser or API client like Postman.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

1. **GET /employees**

   - **Description:** Retrieve a list of all employees.
   - **Request:**  
     ```http
     GET /employees HTTP/1.1
     Host: localhost:8080
     ```
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "John Doe",
         "department": "Engineering",
         "position": "Developer"
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "name": "Jane Smith",
         "department": "HR",
         "position": "Manager"
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **POST /employees**

   - **Description:** Create a new employee record.
   - **Request:**  
     ```http
     POST /employees HTTP/1.1
     Host: localhost:8080
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```
   - **Request Body Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Alice Johnson",
       "department": "Marketing",
       "position": "Coordinator"
     }
     ```
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "id": 3,
       "name": "Alice Johnson",
       "department": "Marketing",
       "position": "Coordinator"
     }
     ```

> **Tip:** Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/) for testing these endpoints.

## Testing the Endpoints

- **Using cURL:**

  To retrieve all employees:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/employees
  ```

  To add a new employee:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/employees \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"name": "Alice Johnson", "department": "Marketing", "position": "Coordinator"}'
  ```

- **Using Postman:**

  Import the sample JSON data into Postman to simulate GET and POST operations. Ensure the header `Content-Type: application/json` is set for POST requests.
